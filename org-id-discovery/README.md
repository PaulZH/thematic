# Organization ID and Discovery

## Use cases:

Various linked data exports require IDs for identifying (parts) of an administration as publisher, maintainer or responsible party:
- BOSA "linked data dashboard" registry applications like GDPR registry, website registry... 
- EU Regulations/Directives requiring regional/national portals to be harvested, e.g. PSI/Open Data, Single Digital Gateway...

## Linking to existing (non-official) sources

It is recommended to link the URI from the official source(s) to well-known but unofficial linked data sources like 
[KBOData.be](http://kbodata.be/) (a private initiative of Paul Hermans, but used by some Flemish agencies) and
[OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com) (a award-winning semi-commercial initiave harvesting company information from around the globe),
using a owl:sameAs or skos:exactMatch
