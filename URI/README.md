# URI strategy

## Context


Today data has been recognised as a fundamental resource in our (digital) society. Data is collected, shared and enriched at
increasing speeds and amounts. Datasets not only grow, but also get more interconnected with each other. This applies to all sectors,
including the government.

In this web of data, retrieval of information is challenging. As the data is often modelled from a specific perspective,
it cannot easily be reused by other applications, without analysing and transforming it. This lack of interoperability (IoP) is
expensive and slows down innovation.

The European Commission defines IoP as the ability of organisations to share information and knowledge, through the business processes
they support, by exchanging data between their ICT systems (2017). There does not exist a simple and unique recipe for raising
interoperability, in a complex ecosystem with a large group of heterogeneous stakeholders.
As stated in the European Interoperability Framework, agreements at different levels, i.e. legislative, organisational,
semantical and technical, are needed to reduce the hurdles to (re)use data.

Despite the IoP challenges, the web of data is emerging. Of all the different approaches,
the most successful is the World Wide Web invented by Tim Berners-Lee. It is a living example of how documents are connected forming
an enormous distributed web. The key to its success is the ability to combine in a simple and cheap process documents together,
namely by using dereferenceable* identifiers for documents: URI’s. At the start of the millennium,
Tim Berners-Lee’s original idea is applied not to documents, but data. The Web of (Linked) Data emerges.

The to-be-designed URI strategy will contain a set of rules for dereferenceable identifiers for data.
URIs that implement these rules yield more trust, and therefore, the data that is built with them will be more trusted.
The existence of the URI strategy facilitates uptake as implementations and tools can be reused.

(*) _Dereferencing an identifier is a method to retrieve via a protocol the document/data/information which is referred to by the identifier._
